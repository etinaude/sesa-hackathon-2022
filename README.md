## Bus Besties

Made for SESAxWDCC Hackathon 2022, aimed to make boring and long bus rides more fun! \

This is a mobile web app that encourages sharing and collaboration on the bus. People can share their "bus thoughts" anonymously, we also provide a random "Topic of the day" for people to discuss. There is also a collaborative drawing tool, and a cool speed texting game with a leaderboard! \

There will be a QR code on the bus for people to scan, people can interact with people on that bus only, and their session ends when they get off the bus. All the data will be reset in 24 hours, and start fresh next day! \

Here are some screenshots of the prototype we developed over the weekend (in less than 24 hours!). We intend to polish and add new features in the future, including collaborative story building for people to build a story on the bus together!
